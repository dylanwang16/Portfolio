        <h2>Dylan Wang</h2>
        <p>Hi, I'm Dylan! I'm a Computational Media major with concentrations in Intelligence and Interaction Design at the Georgia 
            Institute of Technology. My major combines the computer science major and the literacture, media, and communications major,
            which equips me with a unique combination of technical and creative skills that would otherwise not be seen with most 
            typical comptuer science majors. I am from Johns Creek, Georgia, and some of my hobbies include watching tv shows/movies, 
            playing video games, working out, and singing.</p>
